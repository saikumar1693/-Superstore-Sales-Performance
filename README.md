## 📊 Superstore Sales Performance Dashboard – Power BI Project

This dashboard dives deep into Superstore’s retail dataset to uncover performance trends, regional profitability, and segment-level insights. It was designed to address real-world business questions through clear visual storytelling and interactive features.

### 🔍 Business Objectives

The dashboard was crafted to answer the following key questions:

1. **What are the core performance metrics—Sales, Profit, Returned Orders (%), and YoY trends?**  
2. **How has sales performance shifted compared to the previous year?**  
3. **Which products are driving profits—and which ones are underperforming?**  
4. **How does profit distribution vary across states?**  
5. **How are sales segmented by customer profiles and regions?**
